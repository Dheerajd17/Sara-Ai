Description:

This Python project aims to create a versatile virtual assistant capable of performing various tasks, including:

Voice recognition: Using the speech_recognition library, the assistant can listen for and understand spoken commands.
Text-to-speech: Employing the pyttsx3 library, it can respond verbally to queries and provide information.
Web browsing: The assistant can open websites using the webbrowser module.
Music playback: It can play songs from a specified music library using the webbrowser module.
News updates: The assistant can fetch and read news headlines using the requests library and the News API.
AI-powered conversations: Leveraging the OpenAI API, the assistant can engage in natural language conversations and provide informative responses.
The project integrates multiple libraries and APIs to provide a comprehensive and interactive virtual assistant experience.
